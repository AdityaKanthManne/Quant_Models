# 100 Quantitative Models  
## A Hands-On Journey Through Modern Quantitative Finance

---

> **This repository was built the hard way — by designing models, watching them fail, and making them better.**

---

## Why This Repository Exists

**Learn_DSA_Quant** was created from a simple but demanding idea:

> *You don’t learn quantitative finance by memorizing formulas.  
> You learn it by building systems that break — and understanding why.*

Instead of treating quantitative concepts as isolated theory, this repository turns them into **working research systems** — from simple trading rules to **tail-risk-aware portfolio engines** used in professional environments.

Each of the 100 levels represents a **real step forward**:
- Understanding market behavior  
- Discovering failure modes  
- Designing systems that survive real data  

This is **not** a collection of shortcuts or toy notebooks.  
It is a **complete quantitative learning arc**, built patiently and deliberately.

---

## What You Will Find Here

**100 progressively advanced quantitative models**, each with:

- A clearly defined idea  
- A concrete implementation  
- Explicit assumptions and limitations  
- Research-grade metrics (not cosmetic plots)  
- A strong emphasis on **risk, stability, and robustness**

Every level answers two questions:

> **How does this model work?**  
> **What breaks when markets change?**

## What This Project Covers (and Why It Matters)

### Trading & Signal Foundations (Levels 1–10)

These early models build intuition around **how signals are formed, evaluated, and deployed**.

You learn:
- How simple ideas scale into portfolio systems  
- Why signal timing and alignment matter  
- How small implementation choices create large outcome differences  

---

### Volatility & Derivatives Modeling (Levels 11–18)

Volatility is treated not as a statistic, but as a **market state variable**.

You explore:
- Implied and local volatility surfaces  
- Skew, term structure, and regime behavior  
- How options markets encode risk perception  

---

### Execution & Market Structure (Levels 19–25)

Good strategies fail without good execution.

You gain intuition for:
- Where alpha leaks away  
- How liquidity constraints shape outcomes  
- Why execution is part of the model  

---

### Machine Learning for Alpha (Levels 26–37)

Machine learning is used **carefully, not blindly**.

The focus is on:
- When ML helps  
- When it overfits  
- How to validate signals economically, not just statistically  

---

### Regimes, Drift & Model Survival (Levels 38–50)

Markets evolve. Models must adapt.

These levels reflect how models are monitored **after deployment**, not just before:
- Regime changes  
- Concept drift  
- Performance decay  

---

### Portfolio Construction & Allocation (Levels 51–74)

Here, signals give way to **capital allocation discipline**.

You build:
- Risk-balanced portfolios  
- Regime-aware allocations  
- Drawdown-controlled leverage systems  

This is where individual models become **investment systems**.

---

### Risk, Tails & Dependence (Levels 75–85)

Risk is treated as a **first-class object**, not an afterthought.

You implement:
- VaR and CVaR under multiple assumptions  
- Dependence modeling with copulas  
- EVT-based tail estimation  

---

### Systemic Risk & Market Networks (Levels 86–94)

Markets are connected systems, not isolated assets.

You analyze:
- Systemic importance  
- Spillover effects  
- Network-driven risk  

---

### Extreme Risk & Professional-Grade Systems (Levels 95–100)

The final levels bring everything together.

You build:
- Backtested VaR / ES validation engines  
- Dynamic risk estimation systems  
- EVT-based Expected Shortfall risk-budgeted portfolios  

These mirror **institutional risk frameworks**.

---

## How This Project Is Built

- Research-first mindset  
- Transparent assumptions and fallbacks  
- Metrics over visuals  
- Stability over peak performance  

Every model is written with one question in mind:

> **Would I trust this in production?**

---
