100 Quantitative Models | A Hands-On Journey Through Modern Quantitative Finance
Why This Repository Exists

Learn_DSA_Quant is the result of an intentional decision to learn quantitative finance by building it end-to-end.

Rather than treating quant concepts as isolated theory, this repository turns them into working research systems—from the simplest trading rules to advanced, tail-risk-aware portfolio engines. Each of the 100 levels represents a concrete step forward in understanding how markets behave, how models fail, and how professionals design systems that survive real data.

This is not a showcase of shortcuts or one-off notebooks.
It is a complete quantitative learning arc, built patiently and deliberately.

What You Will Find Here

What This Project Covers (and Why It Matters)
Trading & Signal Foundations (Levels 1–10)

These models build intuition around how signals are formed, evaluated, and deployed.

You learn:

How simple ideas scale into portfolio systems

Why signal timing and alignment matter

How small implementation choices create large outcome differences

Volatility & Derivatives Modeling (Levels 11–18)

Volatility is treated not as a statistic, but as a market state variable.

You explore:

Implied and local volatility surfaces

Skew, term structure, and regime behavior

The link between options markets and risk perception

Execution & Market Structure (Levels 19–25)

Good strategies fail without good execution.

You gain intuition for:

VWAP and POV execution logic

Liquidity-aware trade slicing

Where alpha quietly leaks away

Machine Learning for Alpha (Levels 26–37)

Machine learning is used carefully, not blindly.

Focus areas include:

Dynamic programming strategies

Reinforcement learning agents (DQN, PPO)

Feature importance, decile tests, and stability checks

Regimes, Drift & Model Survival (Levels 38–50)

Markets evolve. Models must adapt.

You work through:

Volatility risk premium dynamics

Concept drift detection

Walk-forward validation and rolling diagnostics

These levels reflect how models are monitored after deployment, not just before.

Portfolio Construction & Allocation (Levels 51–74)

Here, signals give way to capital allocation discipline.

You build:

Risk parity and hierarchical portfolios

Regime-conditioned allocations

Drawdown-aware leverage systems

Risk, Tails & Dependence (Levels 75–85)

Risk is treated as a first-class object.

You implement:

VaR and CVaR under multiple assumptions

Bootstrap and copula-based dependence models

EVT-based tail estimation

Systemic Risk & Market Networks (Levels 86–94)

Markets are connected systems, not isolated assets.

You analyze:

CoVaR, MES, and SRISK

Spillover indices and Granger networks

Dynamic connectedness structures

Extreme Risk & Professional-Grade Systems (Levels 95–100)

The final levels bring everything together.

You build:

Backtested VaR / ES validation engines

Dynamic risk estimation systems

EVT-based Expected Shortfall risk-budgeted portfolios

These mirror institutional risk and portfolio frameworks.

How This Project Is Built

Would I trust this in production?

Who Will Benefit Most

Aspiring Quant Researchers and Analysts

Data Scientists transitioning into finance

Graduate students in quantitative disciplines

Practitioners seeking a structured reference

How to Navigate

Follow levels sequentially for a complete learning journey

Jump to specific domains as a reference

Use .txt files for intuition and theory

Closing Thought

This repository represents curiosity sustained through discipline.
It reflects how quantitative understanding is built—slowly, rigorously, and by confronting uncertainty directly.

If you explore this repository carefully, you will not just see models.
You will see how quantitative thinking evolves.
